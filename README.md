<p> Our system is designed for an automated vehicle spare parts delivery for SPARE BROTHERS’ company which is in its initial state. This is an e-commerce business which acts as an intermediate interface between the customers and suppliers who are dealing with vehicle spare parts such as Motor bike parts, Vehicle oil, vehicle body part, and bicycle equipment. Customer can request various vehicle spare parts at once and the order is placed as a package from the company by using this system. All the transactions are done online so the security is high. Finally, SPARE BROTHERS’ company will be delivered the ordered vehicle spare parts packages to the relevant customers. This system is divided into four functions as admin management, customer management, payment management, and rider management. We are developing this system according to these requirements.

In here, we decide to develop insert, update, delete, search functions and report generating in each function.
